        Below: Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            A while ago, there was a group of monsters. They we're confused with their place in life. They didn't want to scare people or be mean to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these monsters ever wanted to do, was be friendly, have fun, eat cake, throw parties and have movie nights with sleep overs.  
        </p>
        <p>
            And so this group of friends, consisting of Green, Red and Blue formed their own little club where no one was expected to be scare anyone or be mean to anyone at all.      
        </p>
        <p>
            Their club promoted being silly, hanging out your friends, eating cake and being as nice as you possibly could, to everyone around. <br>
            Eventually they opened the club up to anyone who would join them, the only condition being, that you do not wish to scare or be mean to anyone of course!
