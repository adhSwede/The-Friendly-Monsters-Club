        Below: Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            A while ago, there was a group of monsters who were confused with their place in life. They didn't want to scare people or be mean to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these three monsters ever wanted to do, was be friendly, have fun, eat cake, throw parties and have movie nights with sleep overs.  
        </p>
        <p>
            And so this group of friends, consisting of Green, Red and Blue formed their own little club where no one was expected to be mean to anyone at all.      
        </p>
        <p>
            Their club promoted being silly, hanging out your friends, eating cake and being as nice as you possibly could, to everyone around. <br>
            Eventually they opened the club up to anyone who would join them, the only condition being, that you do not wish to scare or be mean to anyone of course!
